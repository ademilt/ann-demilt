# This goal of this code is to find pages from the common crawl archive that discuss or are relevant to COVID-19â€™s economic impact in 2020.
# I plan on using Python to extract raw data from the Common Crawl webpage and inserting the URLs of said data into a list. 

# CDX_Toolkit to find indices
# Searching common crawl index server 
# First approach: extracting data from HTML using beautiful soup, run search 2020 for URLs -- could  not achieve desired results, was not able to extract legitimate data 
# Search use keywords, like 'covid and economy,''pandemic and economy,''covid-19,''coronavirus''financial''economy'
# Create a list of URL values, or multi-dimensional lists with months 

# Second approach:
# using Athena in AWS to query, downloading and uploading data to python using CDX_Toolkit
# access WARC files via Athena
# sort with beautiful soup
